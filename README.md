# Minecraft Server Launcher (MCSL)

A discontinued, free software written in Java (JavaFX) that can run Minecraft servers. It supports normal servers like Spigot and Craftbukkit, network servers with BungeeCord, and it has a remote server access system aswell.

The wiki page is available and it is filled up with content, but it was written in hungarian and there is no translation to english.

## Normal servers (local servers)
This is the main feature. You just need a server file and a few clicks to start a Minecraft server. Serverfiles can be downloaded in the app aswell, but it just contains a few versions of them and they are not the latest ones. The app supports UPnP, so it may open the port of the server for you to makes it able to allow connections from other networks. You can import your Minecraft server into the app if you have one.

## Network servers (BungeeCord)
It can run BungeeCord aswell, but it does not have any dedicated feature.

## Remote server access
The app has a plugin that allows connections remotely to the server trough the app. The plugin has a simple user and group management system with permissions for command sending per command. The features are limited, only log and command sending are available. It has an only-chat feature that can be set for groups and it restricts the log to chat messages, and only allows server messsage sending (/say) instead of commands.

## Other features
It supports adding server files and plugins with dragging and dropping files to the window, screenshot taking with F1 button, command history with up and down arrow per server, player name autocompleting for online players with TAB, server tab detaching to separated window with dragging the tab to the designated place and a timed tasks feature where different tasks can be set that will being completed at the given time.

# Screenshots
It has a nicely designed user-friendly UI with light and dark mode, two supported languages (hungarian, english) and few color themes.
